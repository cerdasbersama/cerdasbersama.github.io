For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</a>

For all the joy you brought to my life

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</h2><br />

                            40. what do you think is important for a song? lyrics  or music? give reasons to support your opinion?</h2><br />
                        in my opinion, the most is music arrangement, cuz instrument is mainly suport the lyric, when the lyric create, the producer should choose the suitable music background, so thats the people can enjoyed the music.. <br />another theres intrument songs, without the lyric or someone sang, but the listener already can enjoyed the music by themself (ex: jazz,piano instrument, etc)i think the most important for a song is the music because in my case i can create a song with music only, without any lyrics it's still beautifull and sounds like a song but if i create a song with lyrics only maybe the poeple who hear me will think i am talking or something else it's why i think music is more important for song<br />
