                                            Text 2 Once Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton. She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.menceritakan tentang apaa teks cerita ini ​</a>

                                            cerita b Inggrispertanyaan nya ada di fotoOnce Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth.When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton. She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly.Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian.Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent.After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique.When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.​</a>

                                            Jamie Bernadette was born Jamie Bernadette Watkins and raised in Kankakee, Illinois, a small town about 70 miles south of Chicago. She was the youngest of 9 children. Her father passed away just 4 months after her birth, leaving her mother to raise all of the children on her own. Growing up with very limited means, Jamie quickly learned much about being self-sufficient, industrious, and independent. Although material possessions were scarce, dreams were not. Jamie was dreaming about being on the big screen since a child of about age 5. She watched movies repeatedly and acted out the scenes, mimicking the actresses she loved. Jamie began acting in Community Theater productions at about age 10 and did some theater in high school as well. Jamie came to a crossroads in her life when she had the choice to stay in her beloved hometown, settle down and get married, or venture out to Los Angeles where dreams of acting awaited her. Most everyone in her small town married and had children at a young age so to do anything but was quite a shock to her friends and family. Jamie came to the decision to try out Hollywood and left with $600 in her pocket and drove across the country by herself. She says that she had two friends in Los Angeles when she first came out. Her very first acting credit was HBO's TV show "Tell Me You Love Me", in which Jamie played a dancer. This earned her SAG (Screen Actors Guild Union) card. After that it was non-stop for Jamie as she went on to act in commercials, films and television shows. Jamie was most recently seen on NCIS: New Orleans, Season 4, Episode 3, titled "The Asset", in which Jamie plays "Callie Tillford", a grad student from the University of Tennessee, but who character Agent Pride, played by Scott Bakula, accuses of being a Russian sleeper agent.

 1.  The Canadian actress, a sleeper contender in this year's best actress Oscar race, earned laughs for remarks about her co-stars and impressed many with her discussion about the importance of movies about the Holocaust. After a well-received screening of 20th Century Fox's The Book Thief, an adaptation of Markus Zusak's 2006 novel of the same title that was released nationwide on Friday, I sat down with the film's director Brian Percival, supporting actor Geoffrey Rush and lead actress Sophie Nelisse, who is just 13. Nelisse, a Canadian who previously appeared in just one other film -- Monsieur Lazhar (2011), which received an Oscar nom for best foreign language film -- was chosen over 1,000 other girls for the part of Liesel, an illiterate youngster who is adopted by an open-minded German family during World War II and learns to read and understand the complexities of the world.</a>

                                            Once Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-E inside the craft Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends, To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her.Cari kata adjective, adverb dan verb di cerita tersebut​</a>

Pink Beach or Pantai Merah Muda is one of the beaches in Komodo island, East Nusa Tenggara. The beach is called Pink Beach because the sand beach is pink. Beach colors mixed with crushed coral, shells, calcium carbonate from marine invertebrates that are very small, and also Foraminifera, microscopic amoeba that has a red body shell. At Pink Beach, there are so many marine organisms. No fewer than 1,000 species of fish, 260 species of coral, and 70 species of sponge can be found here. Having so much marine life, this place is a proper spot for snorkeling and diving for sea sports lovers. The pink color of its beach is a mixture of white sand. 
ELEPHANT
Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they’re one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and white, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique. Most experts reqognize two species of elephant: the Asian elephant and African elephant, who live on separate continents and have many unique features. There are several sub species that belong to one or the other of these two main species, though experts argue over how many subspecies there are and whether or not they constitute separate species. African elephants live in sub-Saharan African, the rainforests of Central and West Africa and the Sahel desert in Mali, according to National Geographic. Asian elephants live in Nepal, India and Southeast Asia in scrub forests and rain forests.

                                            Note: Please translate it in Indonesia with your own language and DO NOT USE ANY TRANSLATION1. Exercise DailyExercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each MealNo matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running. Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per DayKeeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercise. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique willinvolve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.4. Be Sure to Get SleepEven though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.5. Stay MotivatedAn important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.</a>

                                            PERTANYAAN DILEMPIRANMawar: Hi, Eko. I heard that you will go to Bali next week. Eko : That's true. My family and I will spend our long holiday there. You've been to Bali a couple of times, right? Mawar : I have. It's beautiful place. Eko : I see. Can you recommend me a good spot to visit? Mawar : If you want a different experience of Bali, you should visit Nusa Penida. Eko : I haven't ever heard of the place. Where is that? Mawar : It is located in the southeast part of Bali. If you go there, go check Kelingking Beach. Eko : What is interesting about the beach? Mawar : Besides the beauty of the beach, the unique formation of the hill there looks like a T-Rex head. Eko : Really? I think I would like to see that. Mawar: You should. However, going there is quite challenging since it is a secluded area and you have to do a rugged 400m cliffside hike. If you want to journey there, prepare your physique properly. Eko : I see, What if I don't feel like hiking once I go there? Mawar : Well, if you won't do the hike, you can just enjoy the scenic view and take photos from above. For most people, it is more than enough. Eko : What can I do once I reach the bottom? Mawar: If you reach the bottom, you should play at the beach freely. It's like having a beach for yourself. Eko : That sounds fun. I think I will go there after hearing what you've said. Any more tips I should know? Mawar : Just be careful if you want to play at the beach. There are no official lifeguards at the moment. Make sure you don't go too far into the water. You should also bring enough water if you don't want to have dehydration. Eko : I see. Thanks, I'll remember that.mohon bantuannya terima kasih​</a>

                            5. Text 2 Once Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton. She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois.

                            15. cerita b Inggrispertanyaan nya ada di fotoOnce Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth.When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton. She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly.Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian.Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent.After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique.When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.​</h2><br />

                            18. Jamie Bernadette was born Jamie Bernadette Watkins and raised in Kankakee, Illinois, a small town about 70 miles south of Chicago. She was the youngest of 9 children. Her father passed away just 4 months after her birth, leaving her mother to raise all of the children on her own. Growing up with very limited means, Jamie quickly learned much about being self-sufficient, industrious, and independent. Although material possessions were scarce, dreams were not. Jamie was dreaming about being on the big screen since a child of about age 5. She watched movies repeatedly and acted out the scenes, mimicking the actresses she loved. Jamie began acting in Community Theater productions at about age 10 and did some theater in high school as well. Jamie came to a crossroads in her life when she had the choice to stay in her beloved hometown, settle down and get married, or venture out to Los Angeles where dreams of acting awaited her. Most everyone in her small town married and had children at a young age so to do anything but was quite a shock to her friends and family. Jamie came to the decision to try out Hollywood and left with $600 in her pocket and drove across the country by herself. She says that she had two friends in Los Angeles when she first came out. Her very first acting credit was HBO's TV show "Tell Me You Love Me", in which Jamie played a dancer. This earned her SAG (Screen Actors Guild Union) card. After that it was non-stop for Jamie as she went on to act in commercials, films and television shows. Jamie was most recently seen on NCIS: New Orleans, Season 4, Episode 3, titled "The Asset", in which Jamie plays "Callie Tillford", a grad student from the University of Tennessee, but who character Agent Pride, played by Scott Bakula, accuses of being a Russian sleeper agent.

                        Jamie Bernadette lahir Jamie Bernadette Watkins dan dibesarkan di Kankakee, Illinois, sebuah kota kecil sekitar 70 mil selatan Chicago. Dia adalah yang termuda dari 9 anak. Ayahnya meninggal hanya 4 bulan setelah kelahirannya, meninggalkan ibunya untuk membesarkan anak-anaknya sendiri. Tumbuh dengan sarana yang sangat terbatas, Jamie cepat belajar banyak tentang menjadi mandiri, rajin, dan mandiri. Meskipun harta benda langka, mimpi tidak. Jamie bermimpi tentang berada di layar lebar sejak anak berusia sekitar 5. Dia menonton film berulang kali dan berakting di luar adegan, meniru aktris yang dicintainya. Jamie mulai berakting dalam produksi Community Theater pada sekitar usia 10 dan melakukan beberapa teater di sekolah menengah juga. Jamie datang ke persimpangan jalan dalam hidupnya ketika dia punya pilihan untuk tinggal di kampung halamannya yang tercinta, menetap dan menikah, atau menjelajah ke Los Angeles di mana impian untuk berakting menunggunya. Kebanyakan orang di kota kecilnya menikah dan memiliki anak-anak di usia muda sehingga melakukan apa pun tetapi cukup mengejutkan teman-teman dan keluarganya. Jamie sampai pada keputusan untuk mencoba Hollywood dan pergi dengan $ 600 di sakunya dan pergi ke seluruh negeri sendirian. Dia mengatakan bahwa dia punya dua teman di Los Angeles ketika dia pertama kali keluar. Kredit akting pertamanya adalah acara TV HBO "Tell Me You Love Me", di mana Jamie memainkan seorang penari. Ini membuatnya mendapatkan kartu SAG (Screen Actors Guild Union). Setelah itu, ia tidak berhenti untuk Jamie saat ia berakting dalam iklan, film, dan acara televisi. Jamie baru-baru ini terlihat di NCIS: New Orleans, Season 4, Episode 3, berjudul "The Asset", di mana Jamie memainkan "Callie Tillford", seorang mahasiswa pascasarjana dari University of Tennessee, tetapi yang menjadi karakter Agen Pride, dimainkan oleh Scott Bakula, dituduh sebagai agen tidur Rusia. Jamie memberikan adegan perkelahian.

 1.  The Canadian actress, a sleeper contender in this year's best actress Oscar race, earned laughs for remarks about her co-stars and impressed many with her discussion about the importance of movies about the Holocaust. After a well-received screening of 20th Century Fox's The Book Thief, an adaptation of Markus Zusak's 2006 novel of the same title that was released nationwide on Friday, I sat down with the film's director Brian Percival, supporting actor Geoffrey Rush and lead actress Sophie Nelisse, who is just 13. Nelisse, a Canadian who previously appeared in just one other film -- Monsieur Lazhar (2011), which received an Oscar nom for best foreign language film -- was chosen over 1,000 other girls for the part of Liesel, an illiterate youngster who is adopted by an open-minded German family during World War II and learns to read and understand the complexities of the world.</h2><br />
                        Aktris asal Kanada, seorang pesaing tidur di balapan Oscar aktris terbaik tahun ini, mendapatkan tawa untuk komentar tentang rekan mainnya dan terkesan banyak dengan diskusi tentang pentingnya film tentang Holocaust. Setelah pemutaran film The Book Thief 20th Century Fox, adaptasi dari novel 2006 Markus Zusak dengan judul yang sama yang dirilis secara nasional pada hari Jumat, saya duduk dengan sutradara film Brian Percival, aktor pendukung Geoffrey Rush dan aktris utama Sophie Nelisse, yang hanya 13. Nelisse, seorang Kanada yang sebelumnya muncul hanya dalam satu film lain - Monsieur Lazhar (2011), yang menerima nominasi Oscar untuk film berbahasa asing terbaik - dipilih lebih dari 1.000 gadis lain untuk bagian dari Liesel seorang anak muda yang buta huruf yang diadopsi oleh keluarga Jerman yang berpikiran terbuka selama Perang Dunia II dan belajar membaca dan memahami kompleksitas dunia.Aktris asal Kanada, seorang pesaing tidur di balapan Oscar aktris terbaik tahun ini, mendapatkan tawa untuk komentar tentang rekan mainnya dan terkesan banyak dengan diskusi tentang pentingnya film tentang Holocaust.

                            26. Once Superman or Kal-El and his parents, Jor-El and Lara lived on an alien planet called Krypton. Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-E inside the craft Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El, launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends, To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her.Cari kata adjective, adverb dan verb di cerita tersebut​</h2><br />

                            28. PINK BEACH 
Pink Beach or Pantai Merah Muda is one of the beaches in Komodo island, East Nusa Tenggara. The beach is called Pink Beach because the sand beach is pink. Beach colors mixed with crushed coral, shells, calcium carbonate from marine invertebrates that are very small, and also Foraminifera, microscopic amoeba that has a red body shell. At Pink Beach, there are so many marine organisms. No fewer than 1,000 species of fish, 260 species of coral, and 70 species of sponge can be found here. Having so much marine life, this place is a proper spot for snorkeling and diving for sea sports lovers. The pink color of its beach is a mixture of white sand. 
ELEPHANT
Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they’re one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and white, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique. Most experts reqognize two species of elephant: the Asian elephant and African elephant, who live on separate continents and have many unique features. There are several sub species that belong to one or the other of these two main species, though experts argue over how many subspecies there are and whether or not they constitute separate species. African elephants live in sub-Saharan African, the rainforests of Central and West Africa and the Sahel desert in Mali, according to National Geographic. Asian elephants live in Nepal, India and Southeast Asia in scrub forests and rain forests.

                            31. Note: Please translate it in Indonesia with your own language and DO NOT USE ANY TRANSLATION1. Exercise DailyExercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each MealNo matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running. Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise.3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per DayKeeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercise. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique willinvolve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.4. Be Sure to Get SleepEven though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.5. Stay MotivatedAn important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>1. Latihan Setiap Hari</p><p></p><p>Berolahragalah setiap hari setidaknya selama satu jam. Anda tidak harus bunuh diri dengan berlari, joging, dll., Tetapi Anda harus melakukan aktivitas fisik yang moderat dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Jika Anda ingin menurunkan berat badan beberapa kilogram dengan cepat, lakukan latihan intensitas tingkat tinggi. Misalnya, berjalan-jalan dengan kecepatan tinggi selama satu jam. Atau, Anda bisa jogging dan mengatur interval tertentu untuk sprint selama jam itu. Pastikan Anda tidak mengalami rasa sakit yang parah selama latihan. Sekadar peringatan, otot Anda akan terasa nyeri setelah melakukan latihan intensitas tinggi. Ini mungkin menjengkelkan, tetapi itu berarti tubuh Anda berubah menjadi lebih baik. Pastikan untuk tetap terhidrasi, meregangkan tubuh, dan makan makanan dengan jumlah protein yang cukup setelah setiap latihan. Protein akan membantu otot Anda, bukan lemak, membangun kembali.</p><p></p><p>2. Makan Makanan dan Porsi yang Tepat Setiap Makan</p><p></p><p>Tidak peduli seberapa buruk perut Anda menyuruh Anda memilih permen daripada makanan sehat, cobalah untuk menghindari makanan manis. Gula dari permen tidak akan membantu Anda menjadi bugar. Bahkan jika itu hanya satu batang permen, satu pada akhirnya akan mengarah ke yang lain. Buah dan sayuran adalah makanan terbaik untuk dimakan saat sudah bugar. Apel, misalnya, bekerja dengan baik untuk membuat perut terasa kenyang hingga 3 hingga 4 jam. Sayuran hijau seperti kacang hijau dan brokoli menjaga sistem pencernaan tetap bersih dan berjalan.</p><p></p><p>Selain itu, pilihlah daging tanpa lemak seperti kalkun dan ayam. Makanan laut, seperti udang, dan nila juga merupakan alternatif yang bagus. Makanan ini penuh dengan protein dan nutrisi sehat untuk membantu menjaga otot tetap fit dan siap untuk berolahraga. Selain itu, pastikan untuk memberi porsi pada apa yang Anda makan. Metabolisme yang baik berasal dari porsi makan. Cobalah untuk merencanakan makan enam kali sehari dan menetapkan porsi yang lebih kecil, daripada makan tiga kali besar sepanjang hari. Ini juga akan membantu Anda bernapas lebih lancar saat berolahraga daripada terengah-engah. Ini karena Anda akan memiliki lebih sedikit makanan dalam sistem pencernaan Anda, yang berarti lebih banyak energi digunakan untuk olahraga Anda.</p><p>3. Catat Kalori dan Asupan Makanan Per Hari</p><p></p><p>Mencatat berapa banyak kalori yang Anda makan dalam sehari akan membantu dalam merencanakan latihan fisik Anda. Pernah bertanya-tanya mengapa massa tubuh binaragawan begitu besar? Itu karena mereka merencanakan makanan mereka dan mengambil lebih banyak kalori (sehat) daripada orang kebanyakan. Di sisi lain, menurunkan berat badan dan berjuang untuk mendapatkan bentuk tubuh yang lebih kurus akan melibatkan lebih banyak latihan fisik daripada kalori yang Anda konsumsi.</p><p></p><p>4. Pastikan untuk Tidur</p><p></p><p>Meskipun kebanyakan dari kita memiliki pekerjaan delapan jam di siang atau malam hari, sangat penting untuk mendapatkan tidur yang cukup untuk mengisi ulang baterai tubuh. Tidur enam hingga delapan jam akan membuat tubuh tetap sehat sepanjang hari, tetapi jika Anda merasa lelah pada suatu saat setelah pulang kerja, tentu saja, tidurlah sebentar sebelum berolahraga. Anda sebaiknya hanya tidur siang sekitar setengah jam. Ini akan mencegah Anda begadang di malam hari.</p><p></p><p>5. Tetap Termotivasi</p><p></p><p>Kunci penting untuk menjadi bugar adalah menetapkan tujuan dan menjaga pola pikir positif. Jika Anda tetap positif, Anda akan mampu mendorong diri sendiri untuk mendapatkan tubuh bugar yang selalu Anda inginkan</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>maaf kalau salah</p><br />

Being aware of Krypton's impending destruction, Jor-El started building a spacecraft to take Kal-El from Krypton to the Earth. When it was time to launch the spacecraft, Krypton was very dark so Jor-El was as blind as a bat. Soon Jor-El placed young Kal-El Inside the craft. Lara could feel the tension near the spacecraft in the last moments in Krypton She knew that it was the end of the planet, and she could do nothing about it. She watched her husband, Jor-El launching the spacecraft smoothly. Suddenly there was a loud explosion that made Jor-El and Lara stop breathing instantly. Luckily, the spacecraft could escape from Krypton. The strong explosion changed the planet into planetary debris and transformed a radioactive substance that was lethal to super-powered by Earth's yellow sun Kryptonian. Jonathan and Martha Kent, Americans, were driving their car not far from their house when they saw a spacecraft land in the rural area. Then they speeded to the spot and found a young boy inside the spacecraft. They adopted Kal-el and named him Clark Kent. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolis he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.​</h2><br />

He creates a dual identity by wearing different costumes and appearances as Superman or living life as Clark Kent. Upon moving to Metropolis and joining the Daily Planet newspaper, he manages to keep his identity a secret. His stories are written by his friend and colleague Lois Lane, unbeknownst to him.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: The story portrays Superman's journey from his home planet Krypton to becoming a superhero on Earth.

Mawar : If you want a different experience of Bali, you should visit Nusa Penida. Eko : I haven't ever heard of the place. Where is that? Mawar : It is located in the southeast part of Bali. If you go there, go check Kelingking Beach. Eko : What is interesting about the beach? Mawar : Besides the beauty of the beach, the unique formation of the hill there looks like a T-Rex head. Eko : Really? I think I would like to see that. Mawar: You should. However, going there is quite challenging since it is a secluded area and you have to do a rugged 400m cliffside hike. If you want to journey there, prepare your physique properly. Eko : I see, What if I don't feel like hiking once I go there? Mawar : Well, if you won't do the hike, you can just enjoy the scenic view and take photos from above. For most people, it is more than enough. Eko : What can I do once I reach the bottom? Mawar: If you reach the bottom, you should play at the beach freely. It's like having a beach for yourself. Eko : That sounds fun. I think I will go there after hearing what you've said. Any more tips I should know? Mawar : Just be careful if you want to play at the beach. There are no official lifeguards at the moment. Make sure you don't go too far into the water. You should also bring enough water if you don't want to have dehydration. Eko : I see. Thanks, I'll remember that.mohon bantuannya terima kasih​</h2><br />

                            39. After living together, Clark's adoptive parents noticed that Clark had grown up with superhuman powers. His adoptive parents taught Clark to use the powers for helping others, especially the poor and weak people. They also advised him to keep the secret of his superhuman power to protect his family and friends. Clark agreed to do it because he didn't want to endanger his family and friends. ✓ To use his powers to help humanity, Clark disguised himself by creating the alter ego of Superman. In order to get a new appearance, Clark added several elements to each identity to keep them distinct enough to prevent people from matching them. When Clark was Superman, he would appear in the red and blue costume with the letter 'S' emblem and a cape. The real Clark always wore glasses, styled his hair differently, changed his body language, significantly altered his voice, and wore looser clothing and suits that hid his physique. AXIC When he was old enough, Clark Kent left his town for a bigger city to begin his career as a reporter at the Daily Planet. In Metropolls he met his friends and co-workers, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and an editor, Perry White. Clark's mission as Superman was written as headline stories by his friend, Lois. Lois didn't know the subject written was not far from her. Clark smiled from ear to ear knowing that his identity remained a secret.tolong cari verb dari kalimat ini,yg teliti​</h2><br />
