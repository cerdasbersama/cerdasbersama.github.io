                                            How Tsunamis Are FormedThe term of “tsunami” comes from the Japanese which means harbour (“tsu”) and wave (“nami”). A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or a sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale.A tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the earth’s crust can occur at plate boundaries.Subduction of earthquakes are particularly effective in generating tsunami, and occur where denser oceanic plates slip under continental plates.As the displaced water mass moves under the influence of gravity to regain its equilibrium, it radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond.Tsunami always bring great damage. Most of the damage is caused by the huge mass of water behind the initial wave front, as the height of the sea keeps rising fast and floods powerfully into the coastal area.plisss bantu buat 5 pertanya pilihan ganda a, b, c, d, e dan jawabannya dari teks diataas!!! ​</a>

An earthquake is what happen when two blcoks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called teh fault or fault plane. The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions, in the form of  seismic waves, like ripples on a pond. 
The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth's surface , they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!

                                            Earthquakes
An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?
The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. (figure 2) The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. (figure 3) Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us

Fortunately, there was a veryshallow stream near an old house.Whenever the rain fall, the water in the stream got deeper. Mysister and I used to go there to sail paper boats and watch them beingswept away. It was exciting to watch the swift current flow over thestones, carrying away leaves, grass and other refuse from our garden. Wewatched intently as our paper boats were tossed about in the water. Theythen sailed swiftly down the stream and we wondered where they finallyended up.During the rain, we also loved to sit and watch the puddles of waterin our garden. As pools of water were formed, our ducks started splashingabout in them, quacking noisily.Sometimes, we ran out in the rain, threw stones into the puddles ofwater and watched the ripples of water growing bigger and bigger. Thewater looks like rings of silver as the shining raindrops fell onto its surface.Until now, I still think that the rain is better than the burning -heatof the sun. I really likes playing in the rain.What did the writer do during his childhood in rainy days?A. Deepened the water in the stream and sailed paper boatsB. Ran out in the rain and took stones in the water puddles.C. Sailed paper boats and watched the water puddles.D. Sat in the rain, sailed and watched paper boats.​</a>

                                            An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?
The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. (figure 2) The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. (figure 3) Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!

                                            A tsunami (pronounced soo-NAM-ee) is a group of fast moving and very deep waves. The word 'tsunami is Japanese for 'harbor wave because of the devastating effects these waves have had on low-lying Japanese coastal towns.Tsunamis waves travel out in circles from its starting Dont like the ripples caused when thrown into a pool. Tsunami waves are usually less than 1 meter high in the open ocean. The wave become much steeper as they reach the coast where they can reach 30 meters in hight.Tsunamis flow outwards at great speeds. In the deep ocean, the move at up to 800 kilometers per hour.Meanwhile, the shape and height of tsunamis depend on the shape of the ocean floor and coastline mey strike:Powerful tsunamis relate powerful killer waves. They wash away anything in their paths. They cansnap trees like toothpicks, crush houses, lost large boats and rock ashore Flooding from a tsunami may leave people without electricity or clean water to drink. They can also kill people, who may get washed away in the waves and drown.People can do certain things to stay safe during a tsunami The Tsunami Warning System gives a warning just before a tsunami is about to strike. The warning is broadcast on radio and television. Often, sirens placed along the coast sound waming blasts The warning broadcasts tell people when a tsunami will reach their areas People living in low-lying places should move to higher ground right awayAdopted from Christy Steele.

                                            Text 1 This text is for questions 1 to 3A tsunami is a giant wave that can do huge amounts of damage when it hits land. To see how one starts, throw a stone into a pond or lake, and watch the ripples spread out on the surface of the water. A tsunami starts in a similar way to one of these ripples, except that it is not caused by a stone, but by something much bigger, such as an earthquake occurring under the sea.Once it has started, a tsunami can move across the ocean for huge distances. An earthquake off the coast of South America generated a tsunami that traveled west for over 15,000 kilometers and cause enormous damage when it hit the coast of Japan 22 hours later.Tsunamis can be caused by volcanic eruptions as well as by earthquakes. The most deadly tsunami in recorded history was the one that followed the eruption of Indonesia’s Krakatoa volcano in 1883. About 36,000 people died, and what actually killed most of them was the tsunami rather than the eruption itself.Tsunamis wave can hit the land in different ways. Sometimes the sea seems to pull the water back at first, uncovering a large expanse of shoreline. When the sea withdraws like this, the tsunami wave is not far behind, and curious people who have walked out onto this newly expose shoreline may find themselves in great danger. In other cases, the wave arrives suddenly and without warning, a dark wall of water which can uproot trees, knock down stone walls, and smash houses into pieces.1. What is the text about?a.

When we look at classrooms, school corridors and school yard, there are papers, mineral water cups, straws, and napkins here and there. The condition of uncleanliness and discomfort really binders learning and teaching environment. Litters thrown carelessly cause disease, especially empty plastic cups or glasses. They can be tilled out with water coming from the rain. This can be placed for dengue mosquitoes 10 spread out. Besides, these rubbishes can deteriorate the scene. Well painted wall and green school yard do not mean anything if litters are scattered every where. Anyway I notice that most of the students in our school have responsibilities for their school environment. They put their litters on the proper places. But some are not diligent enough to find the dust bins. The numbers of dust bins in our schools. are not enough. More dust bins should be put beside each of steps, outside of the classrooms, and some more along the corridors. Probably one dust bin should be in every ten meters. So when students want to throwaway their litters, they can find the dust bins easily. When school is equipped with sufficient dust bins, we do not have problems of filth and discomfort any more. Our school will be very clean and become a nice place to study.4. What is the writes intention? To ... readers to do something good. a. inform.  b. explain  c. describe d. entertaine. persuade5.

                                            Bantu jawab ka The term of “tsunami” comes from the Japanese which means harbour (“tsu”) and wave (“nami”). A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or a sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale.A tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the earth’s crust can occur at plate boundaries.Subduction of earthquakes are particularly effective in generating tsunami, and occur where denser oceanic plates slip under continental plates.As the displaced water mass moves under the influence of gravity to regain its equilibrium, it radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond.Tsunami always bring great damage. Most of the damage is caused by the huge mass of water behind the initial wave front, as the height of the sea keeps rising fast and floods powerfully into the coastal area.1. 'such large vertical movements of the earth' s crust can occur at... '(paragraph 2 line 3). What does the "occur" mean? 2. Do you think tsunami is a result of human errors or disaster? Explain your answer! ​3. Suppose there a tsunami at your region. What will you bring to save? 4. Where will you go if there tsunami? 5. There is always 'blessing in disguise'.

                                            Text 1 This text is for questions 1 to 3A tsunami is a giant wave that can do huge amounts of damage when it hits land. To see how one starts, throw a stone into a pond or lake, and watch the ripples spread out on the surface of the water. A tsunami starts in a similar way to one of these ripples, except that it is not caused by a stone, but by something much bigger, such as an earthquake occurring under the sea.Once it has started, a tsunami can move across the ocean for huge distances. An earthquake off the coast of South America generated a tsunami that traveled west for over  15,000 kilometers and cause enormous damage when it hit the coast of Japan 22 hours later.Tsunamis can be caused by volcanic eruptions as well as by earthquakes. The most deadly tsunami in recorded history was the one that followed the eruption of Indonesia’s Krakatoa volcano in 1883. About 36,000 people died, and what actually killed most of them was the tsunami rather than the eruption itself.Tsunamis wave can hit the land in different ways. Sometimes the sea seems to pull the water back at first, uncovering a large expanse of shoreline. When the sea withdraws like this, the tsunami wave is not far behind, and curious people who have walked out onto this newly expose shoreline may find themselves in great danger. In other cases, the wave arrives suddenly and without warning, a dark wall of water which can uproot trees, knock down stone walls, and smash houses into pieces.1. What is the text about?a.

                                            What kind of text is it? Analyze the text below completely both its generic structure and linguistic features. Text 1 In today’s world, we found ourselves communicating more and more through online channels such as messaging, social media, and video calls, often at the expense of face to face dialogue. There were certain situations where online communication is unavoidable but others where we opt for virtual over real-life conversation. Which begs the question; is online communication preferable in today’s world? To begin with, I’d like to outline the advantages of online communication. One of the main arguments in its favor is that it opens up the possibility of communicating with people in different places around the globe. This has considerable benefits in the workplace as meetings can take place via videoconferencing between Stockholm, San Francisco, and Shanghai without the need for time- consuming, exhausting, long-haul business trips. Furthermore, it provides opportunities for long- distance families and friends to keep in touch on daily basis. Another point is that written online communication gives us the option of responding either immediately or at a time that suits us as well as allowing us to edit and polish our message. On the other hand, there are several significant drawbacks to over-reliance on online communication. Some experts are concerned that a lack of face-to- face interaction impedes the development of vital social skills such as emphasizing and reacting to situations in real time. Also, the very nature of conversation is different in the virtual world. If short snippets of dialogue embellished with emoticons replace longer stretches of direct conversation with emotions expressed on real faces, we are running the risk of losing the art of real conversation. On balance, I believe the online communication brings an overall advantages in today’s fast-paced, global society. However, we should take care not to overlook the benefits engaging in face-to-face dialogue.</a>

An earthquake is what happen when two blcoks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called teh fault or fault plane. The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions, in the form of  seismic waves, like ripples on a pond. 
The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth's surface , they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!

                            10. Earthquakes
An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?
The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. (figure 2) The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. (figure 3) Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us

It was exciting to watch the swift current flow over thestones, carrying away leaves, grass and other refuse from our garden. Wewatched intently as our paper boats were tossed about in the water. Theythen sailed swiftly down the stream and we wondered where they finallyended up.During the rain, we also loved to sit and watch the puddles of waterin our garden. As pools of water were formed, our ducks started splashingabout in them, quacking noisily.Sometimes, we ran out in the rain, threw stones into the puddles ofwater and watched the ripples of water growing bigger and bigger.

                            20. The term of “tsunami” comes from the Japanese which means harbour (“tsu”) and wave (“nami”). A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or a sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale.
A tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the earth’s crust can occur at plate boundaries.
Subduction of earthquakes are particularly effective in generating tsunami, and occur where denser oceanic plates slip under continental plates.
As the displaced water mass moves under the influence of gravity to regain its equilibrium, it radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond.
Tsunami always bring great damage. Most of the damage is caused by the huge mass of water behind the initial wave front, as the height of the sea keeps rising fast and floods powerfully into the coastal area.

                            23. An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter.
What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?
The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. (figure 2) The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. (figure 3) Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake?
While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us!

                            27. A tsunami (pronounced soo-NAM-ee) is a group of fast moving and very deep waves. The word 'tsunami is Japanese for 'harbor wave because of the devastating effects these waves have had on low-lying Japanese coastal towns.Tsunamis waves travel out in circles from its starting Dont like the ripples caused when thrown into a pool. Tsunami waves are usually less than 1 meter high in the open ocean. The wave become much steeper as they reach the coast where they can reach 30 meters in hight.Tsunamis flow outwards at great speeds. In the deep ocean, the move at up to 800 kilometers per hour.Meanwhile, the shape and height of tsunamis depend on the shape of the ocean floor and coastline mey strike:Powerful tsunamis relate powerful killer waves. They wash away anything in their paths. They cansnap trees like toothpicks, crush houses, lost large boats and rock ashore Flooding from a tsunami may leave people without electricity or clean water to drink. They can also kill people, who may get washed away in the waves and drown.People can do certain things to stay safe during a tsunami The Tsunami Warning System gives a warning just before a tsunami is about to strike. The warning is broadcast on radio and television. Often, sirens placed along the coast sound waming blasts The warning broadcasts tell people when a tsunami will reach their areas People living in low-lying places should move to higher ground right awayAdopted from Christy Steele.

                            33. Text 1 This text is for questions 1 to 3A tsunami is a giant wave that can do huge amounts of damage when it hits land. To see how one starts, throw a stone into a pond or lake, and watch the ripples spread out on the surface of the water. A tsunami starts in a similar way to one of these ripples, except that it is not caused by a stone, but by something much bigger, such as an earthquake occurring under the sea.Once it has started, a tsunami can move across the ocean for huge distances. An earthquake off the coast of South America generated a tsunami that traveled west for over 15,000 kilometers and cause enormous damage when it hit the coast of Japan 22 hours later.Tsunamis can be caused by volcanic eruptions as well as by earthquakes. The most deadly tsunami in recorded history was the one that followed the eruption of Indonesia’s Krakatoa volcano in 1883. About 36,000 people died, and what actually killed most of them was the tsunami rather than the eruption itself.Tsunamis wave can hit the land in different ways. Sometimes the sea seems to pull the water back at first, uncovering a large expanse of shoreline. When the sea withdraws like this, the tsunami wave is not far behind, and curious people who have walked out onto this newly expose shoreline may find themselves in great danger. In other cases, the wave arrives suddenly and without warning, a dark wall of water which can uproot trees, knock down stone walls, and smash houses into pieces.1. What is the text about?a.

When we look at classrooms, school corridors and school yard, there are papers, mineral water cups, straws, and napkins here and there. The condition of uncleanliness and discomfort really binders learning and teaching environment. Litters thrown carelessly cause disease, especially empty plastic cups or glasses. They can be tilled out with water coming from the rain. This can be placed for dengue mosquitoes 10 spread out. Besides, these rubbishes can deteriorate the scene. Well painted wall and green school yard do not mean anything if litters are scattered every where. Anyway I notice that most of the students in our school have responsibilities for their school environment. They put their litters on the proper places. But some are not diligent enough to find the dust bins. The numbers of dust bins in our schools. are not enough. More dust bins should be put beside each of steps, outside of the classrooms, and some more along the corridors. Probably one dust bin should be in every ten meters. So when students want to throwaway their litters, they can find the dust bins easily. When school is equipped with sufficient dust bins, we do not have problems of filth and discomfort any more. Our school will be very clean and become a nice place to study.4. What is the writes intention? To ... readers to do something good. a. inform.  b. explain  c. describe d. entertaine. persuade5.

                            36. Bantu jawab ka The term of “tsunami” comes from the Japanese which means harbour (“tsu”) and wave (“nami”). A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or a sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale.A tsunami can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Such large vertical movements of the earth’s crust can occur at plate boundaries.Subduction of earthquakes are particularly effective in generating tsunami, and occur where denser oceanic plates slip under continental plates.As the displaced water mass moves under the influence of gravity to regain its equilibrium, it radiates across the ocean like ripples on a pond.Tsunami always bring great damage. Most of the damage is caused by the huge mass of water behind the initial wave front, as the height of the sea keeps rising fast and floods powerfully into the coastal area.1. 'such large vertical movements of the earth' s crust can occur at... '(paragraph 2 line 3). What does the "occur" mean? 2. Do you think tsunami is a result of human errors or disaster?

                            40. What kind of text is it? Analyze the text below completely both its generic structure and linguistic features. Text 1 In today’s world, we found ourselves communicating more and more through online channels such as messaging, social media, and video calls, often at the expense of face to face dialogue. There were certain situations where online communication is unavoidable but others where we opt for virtual over real-life conversation. Which begs the question; is online communication preferable in today’s world? To begin with, I’d like to outline the advantages of online communication. One of the main arguments in its favor is that it opens up the possibility of communicating with people in different places around the globe. This has considerable benefits in the workplace as meetings can take place via videoconferencing between Stockholm, San Francisco, and Shanghai without the need for time- consuming, exhausting, long-haul business trips. Furthermore, it provides opportunities for long- distance families and friends to keep in touch on daily basis. Another point is that written online communication gives us the option of responding either immediately or at a time that suits us as well as allowing us to edit and polish our message. On the other hand, there are several significant drawbacks to over-reliance on online communication. Some experts are concerned that a lack of face-to- face interaction impedes the development of vital social skills such as emphasizing and reacting to situations in real time. Also, the very nature of conversation is different in the virtual world. If short snippets of dialogue embellished with emoticons replace longer stretches of direct conversation with emotions expressed on real faces, we are running the risk of losing the art of real conversation. On balance, I believe the online communication brings an overall advantages in today’s fast-paced, global society. However, we should take care not to overlook the benefits engaging in face-to-face dialogue.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Teks macam apa ini? Analisis teks di bawah ini sepenuhnya baik struktur generik maupun fitur linguistiknya. Teks 1 Dalam dunia saat ini, kami semakin sering berkomunikasi melalui saluran online seperti perpesanan, media sosial, dan video call, sering kali dengan mengorbankan dialog tatap muka. Ada situasi tertentu di mana komunikasi online tidak dapat dihindari tetapi ada situasi lain di mana kami memilih percakapan virtual daripada kehidupan nyata. Yang menimbulkan pertanyaan; apakah komunikasi online lebih disukai di dunia saat ini? Pertama-tama, saya ingin menjelaskan keuntungan komunikasi online. Salah satu argumen utama yang mendukungnya adalah bahwa hal itu membuka kemungkinan untuk berkomunikasi dengan orang-orang di berbagai tempat di seluruh dunia. Hal ini memiliki manfaat yang cukup besar di tempat kerja karena pertemuan dapat dilakukan melalui konferensi video antara Stockholm, San Francisco, dan Shanghai tanpa perlu perjalanan bisnis yang memakan waktu, melelahkan, dan jarak jauh. Selain itu, ini memberikan kesempatan bagi keluarga dan teman jarak jauh untuk tetap berhubungan setiap hari. Poin lain adalah bahwa komunikasi online tertulis memberi kita pilihan untuk menanggapi baik segera atau pada waktu yang sesuai dengan kita serta memungkinkan kita untuk mengedit dan memoles pesan kita. Di sisi lain, ada beberapa kelemahan signifikan dari ketergantungan yang berlebihan pada komunikasi online. Beberapa ahli prihatin bahwa kurangnya interaksi tatap muka menghambat perkembangan keterampilan sosial yang penting seperti menekankan dan bereaksi terhadap situasi secara real time. Juga, sifat percakapan berbeda di dunia maya. Jika cuplikan pendek dialog yang dihiasi dengan emotikon menggantikan percakapan langsung yang lebih lama dengan emosi yang diekspresikan di wajah asli, kita berisiko kehilangan seni percakapan yang sebenarnya. Secara seimbang, saya yakin komunikasi online membawa keuntungan keseluruhan dalam masyarakat global yang bergerak cepat saat ini. Namun, kita harus berhati-hati untuk tidak mengabaikan manfaat dari dialog tatap muka.</p><br />
