The width is about 5 cm and the thickness is less than 1 cm. This is the latest product.The phone also has a very good color display. The performance of this smartphone is alsogreat. I can play games that require a high specification. However, sometimes I forget about thetime when I'm playing games on my smartphone.As for social media, I can open those easily. It is easy for me to update my status on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This smartphone helps me to stay connected with my friends.

                                            Keisha visited Aunt Vicky last holiday. Aunt vicky brought her to Ancol. It was a beautiful day. Aunt vicky’s daughter, Farah begged Keisha to build a giant sand castle. Keisha took picture their sand castle and uploaded in her Instagram. Aunt Vicky told her it was too hot to play at the beach without a hat on. Keisha didn’t bring her hat. Aunt Vicky told her not to worry, she could wear one of hers. Keisha tried on two hats. The pink one was really pretty, but it had a long pink ribbon on its back and it was too big for her. The blue hat was so fancy but it was too small, it was her niece’s hat. Keisha had no other choice, she had to wear it to avoid the sun light so she chose the pink one. Even though it was too big for her but she didn’t care. Suddenly, there was big wind blew away her hat, her pink hat flew out to the seashore. We laughed at her. She ran away and tried to catch the hat but it was so hard. She jumped every time the small wave came to her. Finally, she gave up and let the hat gone away and asked her mum to buy the new one. From the text we can infer that....A.Keisha doesn’t like her aunt’s hatB.Keisha didn’t like her aunt’s hatC.Keisha didn’t liked her aunt’s hatD.Keisha doesn’t want to wear her aunt’s hat​</a>

My cat's fur is white and brown. So, I call her "Si Belang" because she has two colors. Belang likes to eat fish. However, sometimes I also feed her tempe and she likes it too. In the afternoon, she likes to play outside. She will run, roll, then climb the tree. She is so playful.I also have a rabbit; a cute rabbit. His fur is white and soft. I like to pet him. He has two long ears. I like to play with him. He also has beautiful eyes. My rabbit likes to eat carrots. He also likes to eat other vegetables. My rabbit's cage was broken last night, so today I will make a new cage for him.-My SmartphoneLast month, my uncle came to visit my home. He had just returned from China after living there for two years. He gave me a present, a new smartphone. I really like it. My smartphone is black. It has a 5 inch screen. The width is about 5 cm and the thickness is less than 1 cm. This is the latest product.The phone also has a very good color display. The performance of this smartphone is alsogreat. I can play games that require a high specification. However, sometimes I forget about thetime when I'm playing games on my smartphone.As for social media, I can open those easily. It is easy for me to update my status on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This smartphone helps me to stay connected with my friends. If I have an assignment from my teacher, it can also help me, as I can find many references from the InternetI really like this new smartphone because it is really helpful in lots of situations.bantu kak​</a>

Part 4: Give your suggestions related to these following problems! Each suggestion should be written in the form of paragraph consisting of at least 5 sentences!
1). Problem 1:
Hi, my name is Anna and I’m twelve years old. I’m into social media these days. I like posting my photos and stories on Instagram. I find it really fun. But some of my friends told me that playing Instagram is useless and it’s just wasting my time. They said that I’ll become an anti-social and live virtually not in a real life. What do you think I should tell my friends? 
2). Problem 2:
My friend, Sisca, is really addicted to her smartphone. She never leaves it. Although bringing smartphone is not allowed in my school, she will take it and hide it so the teachers will never find it out. She tends to feel uneasy and anxious if she doesn’t have her smartphones. How should I tell and help Sisca about this problem?</a>

Hi, my name is Anna and I’m twelve years old. I’m into social media these days. I like posting my photos and stories on Instagram. I find it really fun. But some of my friends told me that playing Instagram is useless and it’s just wasting my time. They said that I’ll become an anti-social and live virtually not in a real life. What do you think I should tell my friends? 
2). Problem 2:
My friend, Sisca, is really addicted to her smartphone. She never leaves it. Although bringing smartphone is not allowed in my school, she will take it and hide it so the teachers will never find it out. She tends to feel uneasy and anxious if she doesn’t have her smartphones. How should I tell and help Sisca about this problem?</h2><br />
                        SUGGESTION OF MODERNIZATION HABIT<br /><br />1. You should balancing the way you social at internet and real life. it's okay to be active at social media but you have to socialize at real life too. but in my opinion you should be more active in real life. greet and chat with your friend and you will feel the true friendship. you will know that your friend will always support you no matter how hard your life goes. not like the social media followers who just care of your pictures and what you act in online but never really helps you in your real life problem situation.<br />2. You should be a role model for her. you should trying to get away from your own phone so your friend will follow what you've done. i'm sure she will did as what you did. don't be afraid to be good to show to others what they should have did. because your friend's habit is not good for her mental and her lifestyle.<br />
