                                            Read the text below and answer number 1 to 5. 
When I was seven years old, I was given a small wallet to keep my pocket-money in. It made me feel grown up and I carried it proudly in my hip pocket.
One day, during recess in school, I discovered that my wallet was missing. I searched all my pockets but could not find it. There was some money in the wallet and without it I could not buy anything to eat. I was close to tears. It was not so much because of losing my precious wallet but because I might get a scolding from my parents. Anyhow I went hungry that day.
After recess I was in no mood to study at all. I kept thinking about how I lost my wallet and what my parents would do to me. How was I going to explain the loss? I did not know whether someone had taken it from my pocket or it had merely fallen out. I prayed that someone would find it and return it to me. My prayers came to nothing. Fortunately I did not have to pay to get on my school bus. My fare was paid monthly.
When I told my mother about my loss, she was clearly angry. I received a long lecture about my carelessness. When my father came home, I received another lecture. Also I was told that there would not be any more wallets for me until I got older.
So for the rest of the year and two years following, I kept my allowance in my pocket, without any wallet. I am glad to say I never lost any money again. I have learned to be more careful. It is not pleasant to lose something and then get scolded for losing it.

                                            Gold is a precious metal. Gold is used as ornaments or as money. Gold is found in many places, but in a small supply. It is often found on the surface of the earth. Since gold is a heavy substance, it is sometimes found loose on bottom of rivers. The gold is found together with sand and rocks, and must be separated from them. It is simple to search for this type of gold. It is not usually necessary to drill for gold, but when a layer of gold is located deep below the surface of the earth, it is possible to drill a hole into the ground. Engineers have developed modern process for removing gold from rocks. Since gold is not very hard, it is sometimes melted and added to other substances for making rings, coins, and art objects. It will be priced forever because it is beautiful, rare, and useful.

                                            The reading habit among Indonesian students is still low. There many reasons for this fact. Firstly, books are relatively expensive in Indonesia. Publishers claim that the price of paper and the production cost of books are high. Therefore, books are expensive yang and most students are unable to buy them.Secondly, if we search for books, it is difficult to find really good quality of books. The chapters do not meet with what the students actually need. Above all, the contents are not worth-reading. Thirdly, there are activities that attract the students, i.e. watching worthless programs like quiz, etc, hitch-hiking around malls and playing game.In conclusion, it is clear that those reasons above are quite enough to make students forget reading.Question1. what is the thesis of the above text?2. how many arguments does the author write to support his thesis? what are they?3. mention the linking words the author uses the beginning of his artuments ?4. what concluding phrase is used by the author?5. what evaluative words and emotive words are used in the text?6. write the text structure of the above text​</a>

                                            Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) syndrome, is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons. It comes and goes with the seasons. Typically starting in the late autumn to early winter and going away during the spring and summer. It begins and ends at about the same time every year.The specific cause of autumn or winter SAD remains unknown. Among the possible reasons why an individual may have it because certain brain hormones triggering attitude-related changes during specific periods of a year. Less sunlight can cause the brains to produce less serotonin – a hormone that directly affects our positive mood; the more serotonin that the brain produces, the better someone feels. The lack of this hormone can result in feeling depressed and exhausted. The most common symptoms of SAD are feeling depressed most of the day. Feeling sluggish or agitated, hopeless, worthless or guilty. Losing interest in things that usually enjoy. Having low energy, problems with sleeping, difficulty concentrating. Experiencing changes in appetite or weight. SAD can get worse and lead to problems if it's not treated. These can include social withdrawal, school or work problems, substance abuse, other mental health disorders even worse suicidal thoughts or behavior.There is some predictability to its onset for those already affected. There are ways to prepare for the return of SAD with preventative measures. Treatment includes light therapy (phototherapy), talk therapy and medication. Light therapy can start to improve symptoms within just a few days. In some cases, though, it can take two or more weeks. Talk therapy focused on modifying negative thoughts, behavior and emotional responses associated with psychological distress. As for medication, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline have been the most studied and appear to be effective medications in the treatment of SAD.

She was wearing a light blue night dress and shoes that were too large for her.“What’s your name? Where do you live?” a kind policeman asked her. But the little girl looked at him and didn’t say anything. No one seemed to know this lost child. Since the police couldn’t get any information from her, they sent her to Yogya Children’s Center.At the Children’s Center, the little remained silent and didn’t talk to anyone. As the people didn’t know her name, they began to call her ‘Little One’. ‘Little One’ underwent a medical examination which showed that she was not a normal, healthy child. Although she was not dumb, she remained silent for four days. It was only then that she began to talk.The nurses looked after her just as they did to other children, and ‘Little One’ seemed quite happy and contended. She was always cheerful and responsive, although she was a bit slow in understanding instructions. When she was allowed to go out of her ward, her face beamed with curiosity and excitement.Meanwhile, the police tried to find her parents. Their efforts proved worthless when no one came to claim her. She was ‘nobody’s child’.‘Little One’ had no place to go. The Center became her home.Which statement is true about “Little One”?1. She was talkative.2. She was a slow learner.3. She preferred to be in her ward.4. She was often visited by her parents.5. She was a smart girl.​</a>

                            7. Read the text below and answer number 1 to 5. 
When I was seven years old, I was given a small wallet to keep my pocket-money in. It made me feel grown up and I carried it proudly in my hip pocket.
One day, during recess in school, I discovered that my wallet was missing. I searched all my pockets but could not find it. There was some money in the wallet and without it I could not buy anything to eat. I was close to tears. It was not so much because of losing my precious wallet but because I might get a scolding from my parents. Anyhow I went hungry that day.
After recess I was in no mood to study at all. I kept thinking about how I lost my wallet and what my parents would do to me. How was I going to explain the loss? I did not know whether someone had taken it from my pocket or it had merely fallen out. I prayed that someone would find it and return it to me. My prayers came to nothing. Fortunately I did not have to pay to get on my school bus. My fare was paid monthly.
When I told my mother about my loss, she was clearly angry. I received a long lecture about my carelessness. When my father came home, I received another lecture. Also I was told that there would not be any more wallets for me until I got older.
So for the rest of the year and two years following, I kept my allowance in my pocket, without any wallet. I am glad to say I never lost any money again. I have learned to be more careful. It is not pleasant to lose something and then get scolded for losing it.

                            23. The reading habit among Indonesian students is still low. There many reasons for this fact. Firstly, books are relatively expensive in Indonesia. Publishers claim that the price of paper and the production cost of books are high. Therefore, books are expensive yang and most students are unable to buy them.Secondly, if we search for books, it is difficult to find really good quality of books. The chapters do not meet with what the students actually need. Above all, the contents are not worth-reading. Thirdly, there are activities that attract the students, i.e. watching worthless programs like quiz, etc, hitch-hiking around malls and playing game.In conclusion, it is clear that those reasons above are quite enough to make students forget reading.Question1. what is the thesis of the above text?2. how many arguments does the author write to support his thesis? what are they?3. mention the linking words the author uses the beginning of his artuments ?4. what concluding phrase is used by the author?5. what evaluative words and emotive words are used in the text?6. write the text structure of the above text​</h2><br />

                            31. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) syndrome, is a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons. It comes and goes with the seasons. Typically starting in the late autumn to early winter and going away during the spring and summer. It begins and ends at about the same time every year.The specific cause of autumn or winter SAD remains unknown. Among the possible reasons why an individual may have it because certain brain hormones triggering attitude-related changes during specific periods of a year. Less sunlight can cause the brains to produce less serotonin – a hormone that directly affects our positive mood; the more serotonin that the brain produces, the better someone feels. The lack of this hormone can result in feeling depressed and exhausted. The most common symptoms of SAD are feeling depressed most of the day. Feeling sluggish or agitated, hopeless, worthless or guilty. Losing interest in things that usually enjoy. Having low energy, problems with sleeping, difficulty concentrating. Experiencing changes in appetite or weight. SAD can get worse and lead to problems if it's not treated. These can include social withdrawal, school or work problems, substance abuse, other mental health disorders even worse suicidal thoughts or behavior.There is some predictability to its onset for those already affected. There are ways to prepare for the return of SAD with preventative measures. Treatment includes light therapy (phototherapy), talk therapy and medication. Light therapy can start to improve symptoms within just a few days. In some cases, though, it can take two or more weeks. Talk therapy focused on modifying negative thoughts, behavior and emotional responses associated with psychological distress. As for medication, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline have been the most studied and appear to be effective medications in the treatment of SAD.

                            34. Read the following text and answer the questions provided below.Question number 1 to 5 is based on the following text.At a quarter to three one afternoon, a little girl, about seven years old, was found wandering outside a police officer in Jenderal Sudirman Street. She was wearing a light blue night dress and shoes that were too large for her.“What’s your name? Where do you live?” a kind policeman asked her. But the little girl looked at him and didn’t say anything. No one seemed to know this lost child. Since the police couldn’t get any information from her, they sent her to Yogya Children’s Center.At the Children’s Center, the little remained silent and didn’t talk to anyone. As the people didn’t know her name, they began to call her ‘Little One’. ‘Little One’ underwent a medical examination which showed that she was not a normal, healthy child. Although she was not dumb, she remained silent for four days. It was only then that she began to talk.The nurses looked after her just as they did to other children, and ‘Little One’ seemed quite happy and contended. She was always cheerful and responsive, although she was a bit slow in understanding instructions. When she was allowed to go out of her ward, her face beamed with curiosity and excitement.Meanwhile, the police tried to find her parents. Their efforts proved worthless when no one came to claim her. She was ‘nobody’s child’.‘Little One’ had no place to go. The Center became her home.Which statement is true about “Little One”?1. She was talkative.2. She was a slow learner.3. She preferred to be in her ward.4. She was often visited by her parents.5. She was a smart girl.​</h2><br />
