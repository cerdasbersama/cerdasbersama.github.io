1.	The Chinese are credited  with the invention of printing. They carved out wooden blocks so as to provide raised surfaces for words and pictures and practiced relief printing as early as ninth century AD. By fourteenth century metal type foundries were operating in China and in Korea as well. However carved relief printing remained popular and the printing process developed  little beyond this stage in either China or Korea
2.	Two common types of body decoration in tribal societies are tattooing and scarification. A tattoo is a design on mark by putting a kind of dye ( usually dark blue) into cut in skin. In scarification, dirt or ashes are put into the cuts instead of dye. In both of these cases, the result is a design that is unique to the person’s tribe. Three lines on each side of man identify him as a member of  Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. A complex geometric  design on a woman’s back identifies her as Nuba-and also makes her more beautiful in eyes of her people.

"At that time, I saw so much rubbish in the ditch of my village, no one wanted to clean it. Then, in an initiative, I cleaned the foul-smelling and piling garbage. Accidentally, King Fahd's Arab prince passed by. He got out of the car and it's strange to see me tattooed cleaning the garbage, "he recalls.
At that time, the Arab prince commented on the tattoo he had with the word haram. Had a debate at that time. However, after that meeting the Arab prince picked him up with a private jet so that Jhony departed for Hajj with a super-VVIP service.artinya apa</a>

                                            1.	The Chinese are credited  with the invention of printing. They carved out wooden blocks so as to provide raised surfaces for words and pictures and practiced relief printing as early as ninth century AD. By fourteenth century metal type foundries were operating in China and in Korea as well. However carved relief printing remained popular and the printing process developed  little beyond this stage in either China or Korea
2.	Two common types of body decoration in tribal societies are tattooing and scarification. A tattoo is a design on mark by putting a kind of dye ( usually dark blue) into cut in skin. In scarification, dirt or ashes are put into the cuts instead of dye. In both of these cases, the result is a design that is unique to the person’s tribe. Three lines on each side of man identify him as a member of  Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. A complex geometric  design on a woman’s back identifies her as Nuba-and also makes her more beautiful in eyes of her people.

1.	The Chinese are credited  with the invention of printing. They carved out wooden blocks so as to provide raised surfaces for words and pictures and practiced relief printing as early as ninth century AD. By fourteenth century metal type foundries were operating in China and in Korea as well. However carved relief printing remained popular and the printing process developed  little beyond this stage in either China or Korea
2.	Two common types of body decoration in tribal societies are tattooing and scarification. A tattoo is a design on mark by putting a kind of dye ( usually dark blue) into cut in skin. In scarification, dirt or ashes are put into the cuts instead of dye. In both of these cases, the result is a design that is unique to the person’s tribe. Three lines on each side of man identify him as a member of  Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. A complex geometric  design on a woman’s back identifies her as Nuba-and also makes her more beautiful in eyes of her people.

Kita dapat tertular HIV dari seseorang yang sudah terinfeksi, walaupun orang itu tidak kelihatan sakit, bahkan dengan hasil tes HIV yang tidak positif.</p><p></p>Pembahasan<p><strong>AIDS </strong>adalah kependekan dari ‘Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome’. Acquired berarti didapat, bukan keturunan. Immune terkait dengan sistem kekebalan tubuh kita. Deficiency berarti kekurangan. Disorder atau sindrom berarti penyakit dengan kumpulan gejala, bukan gejala tertentu. Jadi AIDS berarti kumpulan gejala akibat kekurangan atau kelemahan sistem kekebalan tubuh yang dibentuk setelah kita lahir. AIDS disebabkan oleh infeksi yang disebut HIV atau Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Bila kita terinfeksi HIV, tubuh kita akan mencoba menyerang virus tersebut. Sistem kekebalan kita akan membuat ‘antibodi’, molekul khusus yang menyerang HIV itu. Tes darah untuk HIV mencari antibodi tersebut. Jika ditemukan antibodi tersebut di darah kita, berarti kita terinfeksi HIV. Orang yang mempunyai antibodi terhadap HIV disebut ‘HIV-positif’ atau terinfeksi HIV. Menjadi terinfeksi HIV bukan berarti kita akan terkena penyakit AIDS.</p><p></p>Pelajari lebih lanjut:<p>Pelajari lebih lanjut materi tentang penyebab penyakit AIDS, pada: https://brainly.co.id/tugas/4717040</p><p></p>#BelajarBersamaBrainly #SPJ1<br />

Saya minum terlalu banyak dan itu masalah tapi aku baik-baik saja
Hei, Anda memberitahu teman Anda itu bagus untuk bertemu dengan mereka
Tapi saya harap saya tidak pernah melihat mereka lagi
Aku tahu rusak hati Anda
Pindah ke kota di dalam mobil turun bangkrut dan
Empat tahun, tidak ada panggilan
Sekarang Anda sedang mencari cantik di sebuah bar hotel
Dan aku tidak bisa berhenti
Tidak, aku tidak bisa berhenti
Jadi bayi menarik saya lebih dekat di kursi belakang Rover Anda
Yang saya tahu Anda tidak mampu
Menggigit tato yang pada bahu Anda
Tarik lembar langsung dari sudut
Kasur yang Anda mencuri
Dari teman sekamar Anda kembali Boulder
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Anda, terlihat sebagai baik sebagai hari seperti yang saya bertemu Anda
Aku lupa kenapa aku meninggalkanmu, aku gila
Tinggal, dan bermain lagu Blink-182
Bahwa kami masih mati di Tuscon, oke
Aku tahu rusak hati Anda
Saya pindah ke kota di dalam mobil turun bangkrut dan
Empat tahun, tidak ada panggilan
Sekarang Anda sedang mencari cantik di sebuah bar hotel dan
Aku tidak bisa berhenti
Tidak, aku tidak bisa berhenti
Jadi bayi menarik saya lebih dekat di kursi belakang Rover Anda
Yang saya tahu Anda tidak mampu
Menggigit tato yang pada bahu Anda
Tarik lembar langsung dari sudut
Kasur yang Anda mencuri
Dari teman sekamar Anda kembali Boulder
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Jadi bayi menarik saya lebih dekat di kursi belakang Rover Anda
Yang saya tahu Anda tidak mampu
Menggigit tato yang pada bahu Anda
Tarik lembar langsung dari sudut
Kasur yang Anda mencuri
Dari teman sekamar Anda kembali Boulder
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua (kita tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua)
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua (kita tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua)
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua (kita tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua)
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Kami tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua
Tidak ada yang kita tidak pernah mendapatkan lebih tua<br /><br />
