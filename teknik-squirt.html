Adult Elephants eat in the morning and evening.  They eat lots of leaves and grass.  They use their trunk to suck up water and then squirt it in their mouth.
African Elephants live in grasslands and forests.  Indian Elephants live in jungles. Their habitats are being destroyed
Elephants are beautiful animals.  People must save their habitat and protect them. Without this help all the world’s Elephants will die.
